# What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript is versatile and can be used for both client-side and server-side programming.

## What can you do with JavaScript?

- JavaScript enables you to:

    - Create dynamic and interactive web pages
    - Develop web and mobile applications
    - Build server-side applications using environments like Node.js
    - Work with APIs and handle HTTP requests
    - Create games and other interactive media
    - Automate tasks and processes

## Where does JavaScript code run?

- JavaScript code can run in various environments:

    - Web Browsers: Most commonly, JavaScript runs in web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, where it manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to create interactive web pages.
    - Server-Side: Using environments like Node.js, JavaScript can run on servers to handle backend processes, interact with databases, and serve web content.

## What is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?

JavaScript is the scripting language that developers use to build interactive web pages and applications. ECMAScript, on the other hand, is a standardized specification that JavaScript follows. ECMAScript defines the syntax, types, objects, and the basic functionality that should be available in JavaScript implementations. Essentially, ECMAScript is the blueprint, and JavaScript is the implementation of that blueprint.
