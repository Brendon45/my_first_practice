Linked List Basics:
Definition:

A linked list is a data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.
Node Structure:

In C, a basic linked list node structure typically contains data and a pointer to the next node.

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
Types of Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List:

Each node points to the next node in the sequence, forming a unidirectional chain.
Doubly Linked List:

Each node contains pointers to both the next and the previous nodes, allowing for bidirectional traversal.
Circular Linked List:

The last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop.
Linked List Operations:
Insertion:

Nodes can be inserted at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
Insertion involves creating a new node, updating pointers, and handling edge cases.
Deletion:

Nodes can be removed from the list by updating pointers and freeing memory.
Deleting the head, tail, or a node at a specific position requires special handling.
Traversal:

Traverse the linked list to access and manipulate elements.
Use a loop to move through the nodes, following pointers.
Search:

Search for a specific value in the linked list.
Traverse the list and compare values until a match is found.
Advantages of Linked Lists:
Dynamic Size:

Linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink, as memory is allocated or deallocated as needed.
Insertion and Deletion Efficiency:

Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list can be more efficient than arrays, especially in the middle.
No Pre-allocation:

No need to pre-allocate memory for a fixed number of elements as in arrays.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
Random Access:

Accessing elements by index is not as efficient as arrays. Linked lists require traversal.
Memory Overhead:

Extra memory is required for storing pointers, increasing memory overhead.
